### BioDesign

###### About
This project utilized bacteria cultures harvested from our own skin combined with agrobacterium and bioluminescent bacteria (Aliivibrio fischeri). The conceptual model is to introduce the combined bacteria into plants for glowing veins. I created a video for the course and presented the final results: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFyJNBB_jCk&feature=youtu.be
